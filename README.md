Handwritten Digit Recognition using ANN & CNN on the MNIST Dataset

Overview

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9). Two machine learning models are implemented and compared:
	1.	Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - A fully connected neural network that processes the pixel values of each digit image.
	2.	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - A deep learning model optimized for image classification, using convolutional and pooling layers to extract features.

The models are trained and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The CNN outperforms ANN due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	TensorFlow/Keras
	•	NumPy & Pandas
	•	Matplotlib for visualization
	•	Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

 The CNN model demonstrated superior performance over ANN in handwritten digit classification, highlighting the power of convolutional layers in extracting meaningful patterns from images.
